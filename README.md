# Multilingual-Online-Translator
Simple web scraper that uses BeautifulSoup to download appropriate translations. Users can pick a language in the console, and then write the word to translate. There is also an option to translate the word to all possible languages, but it works only with the English set as a base language. After choosing this option, the program will create a file named {word}.py storing the results.
